# PET-anomalies-detection-in-bayesian-framework


This repository is the re implementation of the Hierarchical Probabilistic U-net and some experience in order to create a PET anomalies dection in a bayesian framework in Pytorch. This work was done during my Master Project in the Medecine Nuclear service from the Hopital Henri Mondor.
